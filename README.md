# Interfacing_LDR_sensor_with_LPC2148-
In this project, we have interfaced the LDR sensor with LPC2148​.  
An LDR is a component that has a variable resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. ​
​The Program performs the following steps:
1. The light intensity is got as input from the user/light source.​
2. Compare input light intensity with Threshold intensity (800).​
3. If the Input Intensity < Threshold intensity, the LED is turned on.​
4. If the Input Intensity > Threshold intensity, the LED is turned off.​
5. LCD displays whether the intensity of light is "Lower" or "Higher" than the threshold intensity.​
